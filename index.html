                What is git?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Git is free and open source distributed version control system designed
                to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and
                efficiency.

                <h2>
                    git init
                </h2>  
                <p>
                    git init is used to create a local repository on your machine. The consequence of git init is that a .git folder that is your local repository is created in your current working directory.

                =>git add .  for all files in current folder<br>
                =>git add *  for all files in your project<br><br>
                The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells git that you want to include
                updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any
                significant wayâ€”changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit .

            <p>
                The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes
                have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by git. Status output does not show you any
                information regarding the committed project history.

                <br>
                git Commit commits the changes to your local repository, which means that all the changes you have made and added in the staging area through git add can now be finally applied to local repository, -m option should always be used with git commit to tell about the nature and description of commit action. It can be a message.

                Remembering all the git commands is a tedious task. To ease the process of using git git provied us a help command which can be used to find help about any command that can be used with git.

                Branches in git
            </h1>
            <p>
                Branches in git are used for independent line of development. They are very useful for collaborative work. They are helpful when for example 5 people are working on a company's highly important software and each of them are working independently, if one developer's code has some error it will cause the whole system to crash, to avoid this each of them developers work on different branches of that project when their branch work has been succesfully tested then they can "merge" their work to the "main branch" that is the base project.

            <h2>

            </h2>
            <p>
                This command will show all the branches in your repository and the current branch will be starred.

                This command will change the current branch to the branch named as BranchName. You should commit the changes in your current branch before using this command.

                This command will merge the master branch with b2 branch, hence adding/deleting all the changes that master has done after the last merge or creation of this branch.
                You must be in b2 branch to do this.

            <h2>
                Merge Conflict
            </h2>
            <p>
                Suppose there are two branches master and b2,
                Both have a file suppose index.html, which is similar in both. A
                developer on master branch edit line#25 of index.html and do a commit.
                Another developer on b2 edit line#50 of index.html and do a commit
                Now if you merge, it will be a success, because both have made changes to same
                file, but to different lines.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, if both the developers have made changes to same line or set of
                lines a conflict will occur, which git cannot handle and it will give a
                message that auto-merging failed.
                <br>
                In case of a merge conflict we have
                three choices to resolve the conflict:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Abort merge:
                         git merge --abort
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Resolve manually:
                        Open the file in some editor and perform the changes manually, add,
                        commit, and f inally perform merge
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        git merge <branchname>
                            Use merge tools:
                            You can use different tools to automate this process like araxis,
                            diffuse, kdiff3, xxdiff, diffmerge
                            $ git mergetool --tool=diffuse
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                We will be resolving this manually.
