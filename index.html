                    Git init is used to create a local repository on your machine. The consequence of git init is that a .git folder that is your local repository is created in your current working directory.

                The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include
                updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any
                significant wayâ€”changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit .

                The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes
                have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. Status output does not show you any
                information regarding the committed project history.

                => git commit -m "msg" <br>
                <br>
                Git Commit commits the changes to your local repository, which means that all the changes you have made and added in the staging area through git add can now be finally applied to local repository, -m option should always be used with git commit to tell about the nature and description of commit action. It can be a message.

                Remembering all the git commands is a tedious task. To ease the process of using git git provied us a help command which can be used to find help about any command that can be used with git.

            <p>
                Branches in git are used for independent line of development. They are very useful for collaborative work. They are helpful when for example 5 people are working on a company's highly important software and each of them are working independently, if one developer's code has some error it will cause the whole system to crash, to avoid this each of them developers work on different branches of that project when their branch work has been succesfully tested then they can "merge" their work to the "main branch" that is the base project.
